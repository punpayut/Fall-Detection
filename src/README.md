# Fall Detection Source Code


### 1. `utils`
This directory contains a set of Python scripts to process video data for a fall detection system. The pipeline involves extracting keypoints from videos, processing these keypoints into sequences, splitting the dataset, and counting the generated sequences.

### 2. `notebook`
This directory contains a set of Jupyter Notebooks for training a model on fall detection, which I have run on Kaggle.
